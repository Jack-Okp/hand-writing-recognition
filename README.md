# Handwriting Recognition Project

A machine learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits and characters. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a web-based prediction interface.

## Key Features
- CNN model for digit recognition
- Data augmentation techniques
- Web application with drawing canvas
- Client-side prediction using TensorFlow.js

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train model: `python main.py`
3. Open `index.html` for predictions

## Technologies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- TensorFlow.js
- Python
- HTML/JavaScript
